# Chatbot with OpenAI, LangChain, and PlayHT

This project demonstrates a simple chatbot application built using LangChain, OpenAI's GPT model, and PlayHT for text-to-speech capabilities. The chatbot can understand user queries and respond with both text and generated audio.

## Features

-   **Conversational AI:** Utilizes OpenAI's GPT model through LangChain for natural language understanding and generation.
-   **Text-to-Speech:** Integrates with the PlayHT API to convert the chatbot's text responses into audio.
-   **Chat History:** Maintains a conversation history using LangChain's memory feature.
-   **Gradio Interface:** Provides a user-friendly web interface for interacting with the chatbot.
